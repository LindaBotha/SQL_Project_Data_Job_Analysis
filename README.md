# Introduction
This project investigates the Data Science job market in terms of highest paying jobs, skills required and job location options (including remote work options) to help identify the most valuable skills, based on demand and salary, to prioritize for career development.
SQL queries for this evaluation can be found here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
This project was started as a way of learning how to apply SQL queries to draw valuable insights from extensive data sets. Much gratitude to Luke Barousse for hosting this course and providing extensive datasets.

As I am a scientist withe extensive expereience in handling data, but no experience with coding language, this was an interesting experiment for me to conduct with data outside of my regular area of expertise, using specifically structured data language.

## Questions to answer:
1. What are the top-paying jobs for a Data Scientist?
2. What are the typical skills required for top paying jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for a Data Scientist?
4. What are the top skills based on salary for a Data Scientist?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn? (high demand and high paying)


# Tools I used
- **SQL** as the main query language
- **PostgreSQL** as the database management system
- **Visual Studio Code** as the integrated development environment (IDE)
- **Git & GitHub** as the version control system and interface for sharing results

# The Analysis
Each query in this project was aimed at answering the 5 questions as outlined above:
### 1. Top paying Data Scientist jobs
To identify the highest paying roles, I focused on only Data Scientist postions in remote locations, where a salary value was given in the table (thus eliminating NULL data).

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id =company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
